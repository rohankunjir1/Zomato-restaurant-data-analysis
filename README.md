In this project, my aim is to provide comprehensive insights for aspiring restaurant owners in India. I will achieve this through:

City Analysis: unveil the best city to open a restaurant
Cuisine Analysis: discover the most-loved cuisines in the market
Dining Type Analysis: understand the dining preferences of potential customers
Best Selling Items Analysis: discover dishes with high customer appeal
Price Range Analysis: determine the sweet spot for pricing dishes

Steps of the Project
Data Preprocessing: clean and organize the dataset, address missing values and refine data quality
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Feature Engineering: explore the dataset through EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Simultaneously perform feature engineering to derive new variables relevant to the project objectives.
